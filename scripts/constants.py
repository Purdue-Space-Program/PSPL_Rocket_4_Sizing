# Conversion factors

## Pressure

PSI2PA = 6894.76  # [Pa/psi] Conversion factor from psi to Pa
PA2PSI = 1 / PSI2PA  # [psi/Pa] Conversion factor from Pa to psi

ATM2PA = 101325  # [Pa/atm] Conversion factor from atm to Pa
PA2ATM = 1 / ATM2PA  # [atm/Pa] Conversion factor from Pa to atm

PA2BAR = 1e-5  # [bar/Pa] Conversion factor from Pa to bar
BAR2PA = 1 / PA2BAR  # [Pa/bar] Conversion factor from bar to Pa

## Temperature

RANK2KELVIN = 5 / 9  # [K/R] Conversion factor from R to K
KELVIN2RANK = 1 / RANK2KELVIN  # [R/K] Conversion factor from K to R

## Mass

LB2KG = 0.453592  # [kg/lbm] Conversion factor from lbm to kg
KG2LB = 1 / LB2KG  # [lbm/kg] Conversion factor from kg to lbm

## Length

IN2M = 0.0254  # [m/in] Conversion factor from in to m
M2IN = 1 / IN2M  # [in/m] Conversion factor from m to in
